# Computational Physics

This repository contains a curated collection of algorithms, scripts, and computational tools developed in the context of advanced studies in theoretical and computational physics. It serves both as a personal archive of learning and a resource aligned with coursework in the MSc in Advanced Physics.

The work presented here follows, extends, or is inspired by key references in the field, notably:

- *Computational Physics* by J.M. Thijssen
- Other classical and contemporary resources relevant to each topic

## Scope and Topics

The repository is organized around core areas in modern physics where computational methods are essential. These include, but are not limited to:

- **Computational Physics**: Numerical methods, recurrence relations, special functions
- **Electrodynamics**: Field simulation, wave propagation, boundary value problems
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Schr√∂dinger equation solvers, time evolution, basis expansions
- **Quantum Molecular Dynamics**: Simulation of atomic systems, time-dependent behavior
- **Quantum Field Theory**: Discretization techniques, propagators, lattice methods

Each script or module is self-contained, documented, and, where appropriate, tested. The implementations prioritize clarity, numerical stability, and fidelity to physical principles.

## Environment and Tools

The code is written primarily in Python (3.11+), leveraging libraries such as:

- `numpy`, `scipy` for numerical computation
- `matplotlib` for visualization
- `sympy` for symbolic manipulation (when relevant)
- `jupyter` notebooks for exploratory work

Future extensions may include compiled languages (e.g., C++) or parallel computing tools when performance is critical.
